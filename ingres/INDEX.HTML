            <p>
                <strong>
                    Computers are machines that perform tasks or calculations according to a set
                    of instructions, or programs. The first fully electronic computers, introduced
                    in the 1940s, were huge machines that required teams of people to operate.
                    Compared to those early machines, today’s computers are amazing. Not only
                    they are thousands of times faster, they can fit on your desk, in your lap, or
                    even in your pocket.

        What can you do with computers?
    </h2>
    <p>
        In the workplace, many people use computers to keep records, analyze
        data, do research, and manage projects. At home, you can use computers to
        find information, store pictures and music, track finances, play games, and
        communicate with others.
    </p>
    <h2>
        The web
    </h2>
    
    <p>
        The World Wide Web (usually called the Web, or web) is a gigantic
        storehouse of information. The web is the most popular part of the internet,
        partly because it displays most information in a visually appealing format.

        Email
    </h2>
    <p>
        Email (short for electronic mail) is a convenient way to communicate with
        others. When you send an email message, it arrives almost instantly in the
        recipients email inbox. You can send email to many people simultaneously,
        and you can save, print, and forward email to others.</p>

    <h2>
        Instant messaging
    </h2>
    <p >
        Instant messaging is like having a real-time conversation with another person
        or a group of people. When you type and send an instant message, the
        message is immediately visible to all participants. Unlike email, all participants
        have to be on-line (connected to the internet) and in front of their computers
        at the same time. Communicating by means of instant messaging is called
        chatting.

        Pictures, music and movies
    </h2>
    <p>
        If you have a digital camera, you can move your pictures from the camera to
        your computer. Then you can print them, create slide shows, or share them
        with others by email or by posting them on a website. You can also listen to
        music on your computer, either by importing (transferring to your computer)
        music from audio CDs or by purchasing songs from a music website.

                            </h3>
                            <p>
                    The computer case is a very important part of the computer. It protects all
                    of the electronic components inside and provides adequate ventilation to
                    prevent overheating.
                    The case also should be capable of allowing you to expand your hardware if
                    the need arises. The ATX case is the one most commonly used today
                            </p>

                    <p>
                    A motherboard is the central printed circuit board in many modern computers
                    and holds many of the crucial components of the system, while providing
                    connectors for other peripherals.

                    <p>
                        The power supply supplies the electrical power for a computer. It supplies
                        power to the motherboard, drives, and certain expansion cards. It normally
                        has at least one fan that helps cool the power supply and will assist in the
                        task of cooling the computer.

                            <P>
                    RAM is an abbreviation for Random Access Memory. RAM is the computer’s
                    main memory. The computer uses RAM constantly to temporarily store
                    information while it is working with it.

                            </h3>
                            <p>
                    Case fans are relatively inexpensives and are extremely importants. Computer
                    components generate quite a bit of heat and must be kept as cool as possible.
                    The case fan is the primary source of cooling for most computers. Although
                    the importance of the fan is often overlooked, it is the key to a long life for
                    a computer.

                    Your computers hard disk drive stores information on a hard disk, a rigid
                    platter or stack of platters with a magnetic surface. Because hard disks can
                    hold massive amounts of information, they usually serve as your computer’s
                    primary means of storage, holding almost all of your programs and files.
